# openOrdersSite
A little project I'm making to outsource delivery to those in your community! Purchasers pay a small commission to the deliverers, or don't! We take no cut, so it doesn't matter to us.

I think I'll make this the website and turn it into an app in a separate repo.

This website will probably be made in GatsbyJS.
